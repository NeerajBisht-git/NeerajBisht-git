# 👋 Hi, I’m Neeraj Singh Bisht
💻 I'm a Backend Developer with ~2 years of experience crafting secure and scalable web applications using Laravel, PHP, and Vue.js.

🚀 My work has powered production-grade systems involving:

- **RESTful API** development with Laravel and Lumen  
- **Full-stack features** using Vue.js and Blade templating  
- **Secure authentication** flows with OAuth2 + PKCE and RBAC  
- **Payment and messaging** integrations like Razorpay, Twilio, Stripe, Google APIs  
- Real-time sync, **automated alerts**, and queue-based notification systems

🎯 I love solving real-world problems through backend logic, collaborating across teams, and building systems that are both reliable and easy to maintain.

🌱 Currently diving deeper into system design, scalable architecture, and DevOps workflows to sharpen my backend edge.
